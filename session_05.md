# Demystifying Terms Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence
## Artificial Intelligence
The AI is the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally required human intelligence such as visual perception ,speech recognition,decision,making and translation between language.
## Artificial General Intelligence
## History of Artificial Intelligence
* 1950 - is the introduction of AI
  -1950 Alen Turing published a paper in which he speculated about the possibility of creating machines that think so he created what is known as "Turing Test "
  -This test is basically used to determine wether or not compute can think intelligently like a human being.
  -He noted that thinking is dificult to define and divised his famous "Turing test".
  -It was reasonable to say that the machine is thinking meaning that the machine will pass the turing test.
* 1951 - by the using ferranti mark 1 machine of the university of machister a computer scientist known as Christopor strachey.
       - Christophor strachey wrote a checkers program and dietrich prinz wrote one for chess
* 1956 - The term Artificial Intelligence was coined.
       - John mccarthy first coined the term Artificial Intelligence in 1956 at the "Dartmouth" conference .
*1959 - The first AI laboratory was estabilished.
      - The first AI lab MIT AI lab was first set up in 1959 the reserch on AI begain.
*1960 - First Robot was introduced to general motors assemply line.
*1961 - The first AI chatbot called ELIZA was introduced .
*1997 - IBM deep blue beats world chambion garry kasparov in the game of chess.
*2005 - Stanford Raung teams autonomous robotic car, Stanley win the 2005 DARPA Grand challenge.
      - This is the another big achivement of AI.
*2011 - IBM's questions answering system. Watson defeated the two greatest jeopardy champion brad ratter and Ken jenning.
